# Appdev_task2
one thing which i tried  very hard but was not able to do was that at the last activity where the scores are displayed , when the cancel button is clicked , it redirects to the second activity but when then we click any category than the same set of questions reappear.
so every time if we need to start a new quiz with different category , we need to restart the app
